# Branches
`main` deploy
`develop` 
`feature` to develop new features that branches off the develop branch 
`release` help prepare a new production release; usually branched from the develop branch and must be merged back to both develop and master
`hotfix` also helps prepare for a release but unlike release branches, hotfix branches arise from a bug that has been discovered and must be resolved; it enables developers to keep working on their own changes on the develop branch while the bug is being fixed.
